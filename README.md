Meme Zoo Single-Player Game Features

Egg Incubation System: Players place eggs into an incubator where they hatch into various meme creatures after a countdown timer. Upgrading the incubator increases the probability of hatching rarer and more valuable memes.

Meme Collection: After hatching, memes generate coins passively over time. Players collect and manage a growing variety of these memes, each with unique stats influencing income.

Resource Management: Coins earned are used to buy additional eggs, upgrade the incubator for better hatching odds, feed memes to level them up, and expand zoo pens to hold more memes.

Feeding & Leveling: Players can feed memes with other memes to increase their level and improve their income generation rate.

Meme Fusion: Select combinations of memes can be fused to create new, rarer memes. This fusion system drives progression and unlocks access to more powerful meme varieties.

Zoo Expansion: Players expand pen capacity to accommodate more memes, directly boosting total passive income.

Pure Incremental Progression: All progression is based on incremental upgrades through gameplayâ€”there is no premium currency, real-time fighting, or multiplayer components.

Timer-Based Gameplay: Incubation and other upgrade timers add pacing, requiring players to plan and manage resources efficiently.
